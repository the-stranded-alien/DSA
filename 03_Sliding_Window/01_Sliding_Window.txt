Sliding Window Introduction

- Useful in solving problems on arrays and strings.
- Can reduce the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N).

- Type 1 => Fixed Window Length

The length of the window is fixed and it asks you to find something in the window
such as the max sum of all windows, the median or maximum number of each window.
Usually we need kind of variables to maintain the state of the window, some are as
simple as integer or it could be as complicated as some advanced data structure such
as list, queue, or deque.
