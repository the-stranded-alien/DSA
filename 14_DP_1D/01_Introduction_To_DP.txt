# DP is all about "Remembering" what you have solved in the past.

=> In Recursion, In most cases there are overlapping sub-problems.
=> We use Memoization along with Recursion to avoid this.

=> Top Down DP :- In top down DP, we start building the big solution right
way by explaining how you build it from smaller solutions. (Recursion + Memoization)

=> Bottom Up DP :- In bottom up DP, we start with small solutions and then
use the small solutions to build larger solutions. (Iterative + Memoization)

NOTE =>

1. DP is an Optimisation Technique.
2. For Problems with Optimal Sub-Structure & Overlapping Sub-Problems.
3. DP Solutions Can be :
    A. Top Down (Recursion + Memoization)
    B. Bottom Up (Iterative)
4. Top Down is Generally Easy While Bottom Up Approach is Generally Faster.
